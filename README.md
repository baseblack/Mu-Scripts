# Mu Scripts - For general use in RVIO

There are tonnes of scripts available for adding burnins etc onto video/stills generated by RVIO. 
Here are a few of the ones which we use.

###Positional Burnins###

Personally I like to be able to choose which burnins and what to have in each by individually selecting and 
specifiying them on the cmdline.

For example:

    -overlay topright "14/02/12"

###SuperX Burns###

RV ships with a standard frameburn script. This simply adds to it.

Additional parameter arguments are the position to place the burnin, ie topleft, bottomright etc, 
and the frame to start counting from, for example for a sequence of frames numbered 1010-1020 count from 1010 rather 
than 0001 as is the default behaviour.

The superrangeburn does the same, providing a burnin showing the [$first-$last] frames.

**Prototype:**

    `-overlay superframeburn <position> <firstframe> <opacity> <color> <fontsize>`

**Example:**

    `-overlay superframeburn bottomright 1326 1.0 1.0 14`
